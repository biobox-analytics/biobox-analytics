classes:
  ChipSeq:
    is_a: EpigeneticExperiment
    description: >-
      A method to determine the genomic regions that proteins bind to.

  NarrowPeak:
    is_a: Object
    description: >-
      Peaks of signal enrichment based on pooled, normalized (interpreted) data. It is a BED6+4 format.
    slots:
      - chr
      - start
      - end
      - strand
    attributes:
      score:
        range: integer
        description: >-
          Indicates how dark the peak will be displayed in the browser (0-1000). 
          If all scores were "'0"' when the data were submitted to the DCC, 
          the DCC assigned scores 1-1000 based on signal value. 
          Ideally the average signalValue per base spread is between 100-1000.
      signalValue:
        range: float
        description: >-
          Measurement of overall (usually, average) enrichment for the region.
      pValue:
        range: float
        description: >-
          Measurement of statistical significance (-log10). Use -1 if no pValue is assigned.
      qValue:
        range: float
        description: >-
          Measurement of statistical significance using false discovery rate (-log10). Use -1 if no qValue is assigned.
      peak:
        range: integer
        description: >-
          Point-source called for this peak; 0-based offset _from chromStart. Use -1 if no point-source called.
