  NarrowPeak:
    is_a: Peak
    description: >-
      Peaks of signal enrichment based on pooled, normalized (interpreted) data. It is a BED6+4 format.

    attributes:
      score:
        range: integer
        description: >-
          Indicates how dark the peak will be displayed in the browser (0-1000). 
          If all scores were "'0"' when the data were submitted to the DCC, 
          the DCC assigned scores 1-1000 based on signal value. 
          Ideally the average signalValue per base spread is between 100-1000.
      signalValue:
        range: float
        description: >-
          Measurement of overall (usually, average) enrichment for the region.
      pValue:
        range: float
        description: >-
          Measurement of statistical significance (-log10). Use -1 if no pValue is assigned.
      qValue:
        range: float
        description: >-
          Measurement of statistical significance using false discovery rate (-log10). Use -1 if no qValue is assigned.
      peak:
        range: integer
        description: >-
          Point-source called for this peak; 0-based offset _from chromStart. Use -1 if no point-source called.

    is_a: Edge
    description: >-
      A gene has a translation to a protein.

        range: Protein

  assay target on:
    is_a: Edge
    description: >-
      Describes the target for the immuno-precipitation and/or pull down assay.
    slot_usage:
      _from:
        range: ChipSeq
      to:
        range: Protein

  peak detected _from:
    is_a: Edge
    description: >-
      Describes the relationship between a peak (Narrow, Gap, Broad) and the originating sequencing dataset.
    slot_usage:
      _from:
        range: Peak
      to:
        range: Experiment

slots:
  chr:
    range: string
    description: >-
      Name of the chromosome (or contig, scaffold, etc.)

  start:
    range: integer
    description: >-
      The starting position of the feature in the chromosome or scaffold. The first base in a chromosome is numbered 0

  end:
    range: integer
    description: >-
      The ending position of the feature in the chromosome or scaffold.
      The chromEnd base is not included in the display of the feature.
      For example, the first 100 bases of a chromosome are defined as chromStart=0, chromEnd=100, 
      and span the bases numbered 0-99.

  strand:
    range: string
    description: >-
      +/- to denote strand or orientation (whenever applicable). Use "." if no orientation is assigned.
