  CellularComponent:
    is_a: Object
    description: >-
      A location relative to cellular compartments and structures occupied by a macromolecular machine.
      There are three types of cellular components described in the gene ontology: (1) the cellular anatomical entity
      where a gene product carries out a molecular function (e.g. plasma membrane cytoskeleton) or membrane-enclosed 
      compartments (e.g. mitochondrion); (2) virion components where viral proteins act and (3) the stable
      macromolecular complexes of which gene product are parts (e.g. the clathrin complex)

  BiologicalProcess:
    is_a: Object
    description: >-
      A biological process is the execution of a genetically-encoded biological module or program. 
      It consists of all the steps required to achieve the specific biological objective of the module. 
      A biological process is accomplished by a particular set of molecular functions carried out by specific 
      gene products (or macromolecular complexes) often in a highly regulated manner and in a 
      particular temporal sequence.

  MolecularFunction:
    is_a: Object
    description: >-
      A molecular process that can be carried out by the action of a single macromolecular machine 
      usually via direct physical interactions with other molecular entities. Function in this sense 
      denotes an action or activity that a gene product (or a complex) performs
