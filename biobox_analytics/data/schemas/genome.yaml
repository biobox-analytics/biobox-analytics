    description: >-
      Name of the chromosome (or contig, scaffold, etc.)

  start:
    range: integer
    description: >-
      The starting position of the feature in the chromosome or scaffold. The first base in a chromosome is numbered 1

  end:

    description: >-
      The ending position of the feature in the chromosome or scaffold.
      The chromEnd base is not included in the display of the feature.
      For example, the first 100 bases of a chromosome are defined as chromStart=1, chromEnd=100, 
      and span the bases numbered 1-100.

  strand:
